# MTC
Multiplicative Triple Collocation code
Multiplicative Triple Collocation (MTC) calculates the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient between three sets of data (from different measurement systems) and the true. The difference between MTCand classical TC is that in MTC the error model is multiplicative which is more appropriate in case of e.g. precipitation data.
